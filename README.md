This project is made using python purely. In order for this to work as intended, name your black and white image as "black and white.jpg". This is how the file would read your image. Next, create a folder in your c drive 
i.e. "C:\COLOURED PHOTOS". Yes, literally in the first part of your c drive.
This is where your coloured photos would store. it would store with the same extension as "black and white.jpg". if you wish to store your next coloured image, then rename the colourised image to some other name and proceed with the steps above. 
The app will open your command prompt to run its program. no need to worry, because that is how this works

This is still a work in progress, please do share your opinions on how I can improve it.
I will try my best to give a regular update on the machine learning model.
